## 🚀 About Me
I’m a software engineer with a strong background in AI and video game development, now expanding my expertise towards broader software engineering challenges.  

With several years of experience designing complex systems — including projects in the military and defense sector — I thrive on solving problems, creating innovative solutions, and adapting quickly to new technologies. My work spans from AI logic and interactive systems to building user-focused applications and robust software pipelines.  

I’m driven by curiosity, a passion for learning, and the ambition to develop impactful, reliable, and scalable software solutions.  

Beyond development, I also lecture in higher education, sharing my knowledge and fostering creativity in the next generation of developers.
